//23rd November | Step to solve the Save problem

 * Trying to remove the Icon Image that I've added to the SQLite database, Instead of that try to save the image locally
   then fetch as all the other Icons.
 STEP 1: Initially, changing the board option only.
   * Store the image into local storage/boardicon/boardID.png
   * Replace the image when board is editing, first delete then again save with same name
   * On deleting the board delete the image from database
   * Keep track of all such images, and upload to firebase when needed.
